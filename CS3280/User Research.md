## Types of user research
#### Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research
##### Qualitative Research (why + how)
 - **Focus**: Understanding user behavior, motivations, feelings
 - **Data**: Non-numerical
 - **Methods**:
   - Interviews
   - Observations (ethnography)
   - Think-aloud usability tests
   - Diary studies
- **Strength**: Deep insights
- **Weakness**: Smaller sample, not statistically generalizable
##### Quantitative Research (what + how much)]
 - **Focus**: Measurable data about behavior
 - **Data**: Numbers, metrics
 - **Methods**:
     - Surveys
     - Analytics (click rates, time-on-task)
     - A/B testing
     - Log data
 - **Strength**: Statistically measurable
 - **Weakness**: Does not explain why behavior happens

#### Formative vs. Summative Research
##### Formative Research
 - Done early in the design process
 - Helps shape the problem and explore ideas
 - Examples: interviews, field studies, contextual inquiry
   
##### Summative Research
 - Done after or during prototyping
 - Measures the effectiveness of a design
 - Examples: usability testing with metrics, benchmarking
   
## How to conduct user research
| Step | Descript|
|------|---------|
| Step 1 | Define the Goals |
| Step 2 | Choose the Methods |
| Step 3 | Recruit Participants |
| Step 4 | Collect the Data |
| Step 5 | Analyze the Data |
| Step 6 | Communicate Findings |


## Personas, Scenarios, & User Flows
>These are user-centered design artifacts that help designers keep real user needs in mind.
Definition:

>A persona is a fictional but research-based representation of a target user type.
It summarizes behaviors, goals, needs, motivations, and pain points.


### Scenarios
Definition:
A scenario is a story describing:
 - a persona
 - in a specific context
 - trying to achieve a goal
 - using the system
  

#### Types of Scenarios
|Type|Decript|
|-----|-----|
|Goal-Based Scenario | Persona trying to accomplish a goal|
|Contextual Scenario | Focuses on environment, constraints, and context |
| Key Path Scenario | Main flow the persona takes to complete a task |
| Error Scenarios | What happens when things go wrong|


### User Flows
> **Definition**: A user flow is a diagram showing the step-by-step path a user takes to complete a task in a system.

##### It represents:
 - Screens
 - Actions
 - Decisions
 - Navigation paths


#### Types of User Flows
| Flow | Descript |
|------|-----------|
| Task Flow | Linear sequence (e.g., “buy item” |
| User Flow | Multiple decision points and paths |
| Wireflow | Combines wireframes + flows |
| App Flow / Site Map | High-level structure of all screens/pages |

### Summary
| Concept           | Definition                             | Why It’s Important              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **User Research** | Understanding user needs and behaviors | Ensures design is user-centered |
| **Personas**      | Fictional profiles based on research   | Keeps focus on the user         |
| **Scenarios**     | Stories of users accomplishing goals   | Helps visualize real-world use  |
| **User Flows**    | Step-by-step paths to complete tasks   | Guides navigation and structure |
