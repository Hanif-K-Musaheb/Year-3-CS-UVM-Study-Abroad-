## Usable privacy & security
Usable privacy and security is about designing security systems that are both secure AND easy for humans to use.

The key idea:
> A system is not secure if users cannot understand it, configure it, or use it correctly.

> Security must align with human behavior, not expect humans to behave like security experts.

##### If security is too difficult:
 - Users will choose weak passwords
 - Users will disable security features
 - Users will reuse passwords
 - Users will ignore warnings
 - Users will fall for phishing

|Principle of Usable Security| Example|
|----------------|----------------|
|Make secure behavior the default|Auto-updates, Strong password requirements, Two-factor authentication prompts|
|Reduce mental workload| Password managers, Biometric login (FaceID, TouchID)|
|Give clear, actionable warnings|**Bad example**:“Security certificate error.”, **Good example**:“This website may be unsafe. Attackers might steal your information. It’s best to go back.”|
|Support user mental models|Users should understand why security matters and how it works.|


## dark patterns
>Dark patterns are design choices that intentionally trick or manipulate users into doing something they did not intend.

#### Types of Dark Patterns (Common Examples)
|Types|Description|
|-----|----------|
|Privacy Zuckering|Coercing users into sharing more data than they want.|
|Forced Continuity|Making it hard to cancel subscriptions; auto-renew without warning.|
|Sneak into Basket|Adding items to cart without permission.|
|Roach Motel|Easy to get into something, hard to get out (e.g., deleting account).|
|Confirmshaming|Guilt-tripping choices. Example:“No thanks, I hate saving money.”|
|Disguised Ads|Ads that look like regular content or buttons.|
|Bait and Switch|User tries to do one thing; something else happens.|

## Why Dark Patterns Are Harmful
 - Undermine trust
 - Manipulate vulnerable users
 - Cause ethical and legal issues
 - Increase frustration
 - Lead to regulatory penalties (GDPR, consumer protection laws)
   
## Human-AI interaction
Human–AI interaction focuses on how users understand, trust, control, and collaborate with AI systems.

##### Users must trust AI:
 - Not too little (ignoring helpful recommendations)
 - Not too much (blind reliance on flawed outputs)

### Design priciples for HAII
- Make clear what the AI can do
- Make clear how well it can do it (accuracy, confidence)
- Clarify what data it uses
- Allow users to provide feedback
- Support undo or correction
- Mitigate errors gracefully
- ensure fairness and ethics
