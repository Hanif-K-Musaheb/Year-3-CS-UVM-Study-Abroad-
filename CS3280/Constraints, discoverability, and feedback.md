# [Constraints, discoverability, and feedback](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-3-CS-UVM-Study-Abroad-/blob/main/CS3280/cs3280.md)
## Four types of constraints
### Physical Constraints
 - Physical constraints limit actions based on the laws of physics, shape, size, and structure.
 - **In UI / Digital design:** Buttons that cannot be clicked when disabled, “Drag areas” restricted to certain regions.

### Cultural Constraints
- Cultural constraints rely on **learned conventions, social norms, and accepted meanings**.
- **Examples**: “X” means close; “✓” means confirm, Reading left to right (for some cultures).

### Samantic Constraints
 - Semantic constraints rely on the meaning of a situation or environment.
 - People use contextual clues to determine what actions make sense.
 - **Examples**: In a form, an email field should contain an email, A camera app’s shutter button should be distinct and central.
 - **Benefit**: Users naturally choose the action that “makes sense” for the situation.

### Logical Constraints
Logical constraints are based on **reasoning**, **deduction**, and the **logical relationships** between elements.
##### UI examples:
 - Graying out options that aren’t yet available due to logical dependencies.
 - Step-by-step wizards where users must complete one step before the next.

## How to leverage constraints in design
Designers intentionally use constraints to make systems clearer, safer, and more intuitive. Here is how each constraint type can be leveraged:

### Leveraging Physical Constraints
 - Restrict actions physically or digitally
 - Prevent impossible operations
 - Guide correct manipulation
#### Examples:
 - Snap-to-grid alignment tools
 - Only allowing valid drag-and-drop targets
 - Form fields with masked input (e.g., phone number format)

### Leveraging Cultural Constraints
 - Use well-known icons, signs, colors, and conventions
 - Follow platform standards (Android, iOS, web conventions)
 - Use familiar metaphors (folders, trash cans, play button)

#### Examples:
 - Red error messages
 - Swiping cards sideways (common in mobile apps)
 - Three-line hamburger menu for navigation

### Leveraging Semantic Constraints
 - Place functions where meaning suggests they should go
 - Use context to make actions intuitive
 - Group related items visually or spatially
#### Examples:
- Camera shutter button centered and separated
- “Save” button near the content being edited
- “Next” button on the right (in left-to-right cultures)

### Leveraging Logical Constraints
 - Make relationships obvious
 - Restrict actions until conditions are met
 - Use sequence, exclusion, or dependencies

#### Examples:
 - Disable “Submit” button until form is valid
 - Show only relevant options based on previous selections
 - Use progress indicators (step 1, step 2, etc.)
