## Human factors’ view of HCI (different components)
>Human factors (or ergonomics) looks at how people interact with systems with the goal of improving safety, performance, and usability.

>From a human-factors perspective, HCI is shaped by three major components:


|HCI is shaped by three major components:| | | |
|----|----|----|----|
|**The User**(Human)|**Cognitive factors:** Perception, Attention ,Memory (STM vs LTM), Problem-solving, Decision making, Mental models, Workload and stress|**Physical factors:** Motor skills, Strength and reach, Anthropometrics (human body measurements), Sensory abilities (vision, hearing)|**Individual differences:** Age, Skills, Culture, Disabilities, Experience level
|**The Computer** (System/Technology)|**Input devices**|**Output devices**|**System capabilities**: Speed, Responsiveness, Feedback mechanisms, Error recovery methods|
|**The Interaction** (How user + system communicate)|**Interaction styles:** Command line, Menus, Direct manipulation (drag-and-drop), Form-fill-in, Conversational interaction|**Feedback loops:** System’s response to user actions, Indicators of progress or errors|**Tasks:** What the user wants to accomplish, Task complexity, Task sequences|


## Types of interfaces 
|Type of interface|descript|
|------------|-----------|
|Command-Line Interface (CLI)|already know|
|Graphical User Interface (GUI)|"|
|Form Fill-in Interfaces||
|Menu-Based Interfaces|Users choose from structured options, Reduces memory load, **Example**: ATM menu, settings menu|
|Touch Interfaces|already know|
| AR/VR|"|

## Interactions
- **Instructing** User gives commands or choices.
- **Conversing** User interacts through dialogue.
- **Manipulating** (Direct Manipulation) User interacts with objects on screen as if they are real.
- **Navigating** User moves through information spaces. --> Example: web browsing, file explorer
-
