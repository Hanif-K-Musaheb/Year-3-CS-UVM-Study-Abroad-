> Summary

| Concept                    | What It Means               | Benefit                | Problem               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Knowledge in the Head**  | Info stored by user         | Fast for experts       | Requires memory       |
| **Knowledge in the World** | Info visible in environment | Easy, low memory load  | Can clutter           |
| **STM**                    | Short-term memory           | Enables quick temp use | Very limited capacity |
| **LTM**                    | Long-term memory            | Powerful, stable       | Slow to form          |
| **Recall**                 | Remembering from scratch    | Fast for experts       | Hard for novices      |
| **Recognition**            | Identifying from cues       | Easy, low load         | Can be slow           |

## Knowledge in the Head vs. Knowledge in the World
This is information the user must remember or have stored internally (in memory).

**Pros**:
 - Fast once learned (expert performance)
 - Doesn’t depend on external help
 - Efficient for frequent tasks

**Cons**:
 - Requires learning and practice
 - Easy to forget
 - Hard for new or occasional users

## Knowledge in the World
This is information available externally, embedded in the environment or interface.

**Pros**:
- Reduces memory load
- Easy for beginners
- Helps prevent mistakes
- Supports recognition

**Cons**:
- Can clutter the interface
- Slower for expert users
- Requires the information to be present at the right time

## Memory in HCI (STM vs. LTM)
#### Short-Term Memory (STM)
 - Holds information temporarily (~10–20 seconds)
 - Very limited capacity (≈ 7 ± 2 items → often even fewer)
 - Easily disrupted
 - High cognitive load

#### Long-Term Memory (LTM)
  - Experts rely on strong LTM (shortcuts, workflows)
  - Interfaces should support learning through consistency
  - Meaningful structures help build durable memories

## Recognition vs. Recall (Crucial HCI Principle)
#### Recall
> User must remember information without cues.

> **Harder** --> Requires knowledge in the head.
#### Recognition
> User identifies the correct option from visible cues.

> **Easier** --> Relies on knowledge in the world.
