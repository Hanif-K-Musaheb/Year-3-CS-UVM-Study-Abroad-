# [Design thinking and design process](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-3-CS-UVM-Study-Abroad-/blob/main/CS3280/cs3280.md)
## The double diamond model of design
>The Double Diamond is a design framework created by the UK Design Council.
It describes a complete process from understanding a problem to delivering a solution.

### Diamond 1
1. **Discover** (Divergent thinking)
    -  Goal: Explore the problem space
    -  “Go wide” to gather insights
    -  Research broadly without assuming the solution
    - **Methods: User interviews, observations, surveys, contextual inquiry**
      
2. **Define** (Convergent thinking)
    - Goal: Narrow down and define the real problem
    - Make sense of information gathered
    - Identify patterns, key pain points, core user needs
    - **Methods: Affinity mapping, problem framing, user personas**
### Diamond 2: Develop + Deliver (Creating the Solution)
3. **Develop** (Divergent thinking)
    - Goal: Explore the solution space
    - Generate many ideas
    - Try alternatives, ketch concepts, prototype options
    - **Methods: Brainstorming, sketching, wireframing, rapid prototyping**
      
4. **Deliver** (Convergent thinking)
    - Goal: Test, refine, and finalize the best solution
    - Iterate through prototypes
    - Validate design decisions
    - **Methods: Usability testing, A/B testing, refinement**
      
## Standardization
>Standardization refers to making design consistent, predictable, and familiar across systems.

>It uses conventions, norms, and rules so users do not need to relearn basic interaction patterns.

##### Why Standardization Matters
1. Reduces Cognitive Load
1. Improves Learnability
1. Reduces Errors
1. Supports Accessibility
1. Enhances Efficiency

### Types of Standardization
 - **Internal** Standardization --> Consistency _within_ the same product.
 - **External** Standardization --> Consistency with _industry_ or platform norms.
