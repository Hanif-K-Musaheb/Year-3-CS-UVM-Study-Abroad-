>Summary

| Method Type       | Examples                                               | Pros                             | Cons                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **With Users**    | Usability testing, surveys, field studies, A/B testing | Real behavior, accurate insights | Costly, time-consuming, requires participants |
| **Without Users** | Heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough, GOMS      | Fast, cheap, early design        | Less realistic, misses real user issues       |

## Evaluation methods with and without users (pros & cons)
### With users
> kinda obvious and covered in the summary

 - **Usability Testing** --> Users attempt representative tasks while observers watch.
 - **Field Studies** (Contextual Inquiry, Ethnography) --> Researchers observe users in their natural environment.
 - **Surveys & Questionnaires** --> Users self-report their opinions and satisfaction.
 - **A/B Testing** --> Two versions of a design are compared with real users.

### Evaluation Methods _Without Users_
 - **Heuristic Evaluation** --> Experts evaluate interface based on usability heuristics (e.g., Nielsen’s 10).
 - **Cognitive Walkthrough** --> Experts “step through” tasks from the perspective of a new user.
 - **GOMS / Keystroke-Level Model** --> A predictive model estimating expert task performance time.
 - **Analytics / Log Analysis** --> Uses system-generated data (clicks, time, navigation).

### When to Use Each
#### Use with-user methods when:
 - You have a prototype or system
 - Need real behavior data
 - Want to measure performance (errors, time)
 - Evaluating late-stage designs

#### Use without-user methods when:
 - Early in design
 - No prototype is available
 - Limited time or budget
 - Need quick feedback
