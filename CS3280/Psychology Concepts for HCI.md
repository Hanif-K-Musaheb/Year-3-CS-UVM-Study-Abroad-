### Affordances
###### Definition
 - Affordances are the possible actions that an object or interface makes available to a user.
 - They refer to what a person **can do** with something, based on its properties.
### Signifiers
###### Definition
 - Signifiers are signals that communicate **where** an action should take place and **how** to do it.
 - If affordances are the possible actions, signifiers are the clues telling users about those actions.
> A affordance may exist, but without a signifier, users may not notice it.
### Constraints 
###### Definition:
 - Constraints limit the range of possible user actions, guiding them toward correct usage and reducing errors.
#### Types of constraints:
 - **Physical**: A plug only fits one way.
 - **Logical**: Only one path in a flow makes sense (e.g., you must create an account before you log in).
 - **Cultural**: Red means stop, green means go.
 - **Semantic**: The shape of a cup suggests which end is the top.
> **Purpose**: Constraints protect users from mistakes and simplify choices.
### Mapping
###### Definition:
 - Mapping refers to the relationship between controls and their effects in the world.
 - Good mapping makes these relationships intuitive.

### Feedback
###### Definition:
 - Feedback is the information an interface or system sends back to the user about what action has been done and what the result was.
### Conceptual models (including mental models)
#### Conceptual Models
###### Definition:
 - A conceptual model is the designer’s explanation of how a system works or should be understood.
 - It is the model the system is meant to convey to the user.
Designers build conceptual models into a product using:
 - signifiers
 - feedback
 - mapping
 - metaphors (e.g., “desktop” on computers)

**Goal:**
Help users understand what actions are possible and what will happen when they take them.

#### Mental Models
Definition:
A mental model is the user’s internal understanding of how something works.
##### Mental models:
 - are often incomplete or inaccurate
 - are built from past experiences
 - strongly influence how people behave with a product

###### Key idea:
If the conceptual model (designer’s intent) matches the mental model (user’s understanding), the product becomes intuitive.
