#### Knowledge in the Head
 - Internalized knowledge people carry with them — built from experience, culture, and learning.
 - **Examples**: how to ride a bike, remembering keyboard shortcuts, believing percentages always scale linearly.
#### knowledge in the World
 - Information provided by the environment, interface, or physical cues that guide behavior.
 - **Examples**: road signs, affordances of a door handle, a phone’s battery % display.
