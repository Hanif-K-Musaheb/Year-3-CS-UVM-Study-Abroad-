### PACT analysis
**P**eople conducting **A**ctivities in a **C**ontext using **T**echnology

### Affordances
- is the relationship between properties of an object and the capabilities of an agent
- sometimes affordances are not visible
### Signifiers
- are indicators in teh physical social and digital world that can be interpretred meaningfully and communicate where actions should take place.
### Constraints
are things or ideas indicationg certain actions are not possible
### Mapping
- is when button/ways to perform an action are linked to said action
### Feedback
- is a reaction to response to a particular action
### Conceptual Models
are explantions of how something works
# 2nd chaptar
### The Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation –
 - **The Gulf of Execution** is the gap between what a person wants to do and the actions available to achieve it.
 - **The Gulf of Evaluation** is the gap between what happened and whether the user can understand if it matches their goal. Designers must provide clear signifiers, feedback, and mappings to help users cross these gulfs.

### 🧠 Norman’s Two Types of Knowledge
#### Knowledge in the Head
 - Internalized knowledge people carry with them — built from experience, culture, and learning.
 - **Examples**: how to ride a bike, remembering keyboard shortcuts, believing percentages always scale linearly.
#### knowledge in the World
 - Information provided by the environment, interface, or physical cues that guide behavior.
 - **Examples**: road signs, affordances of a door handle, a phone’s battery % display.
# 4th chaptar
## four types of constraints
 - Physical constraints → the shape or size prevents incorrect use (e.g., a USB plug only fits one way).
 - Cultural constraints → social conventions guide behavior (e.g., red means stop, green means go).
 - Semantic constraints → meaning of the situation limits options (e.g., a rider sits facing forward on a bicycle).
 - Logical constraints → process of elimination makes the correct choice obvious (e.g., puzzle pieces can only fit in one place).
   
## Discoverability
A design should make it obvious what can be done. This ties back to affordances and signifiers from earlier chapters. Users shouldn’t need a manual to figure out simple actions like turning on a faucet or pushing a door.

# 5th chaptar - Human Error? No, Bad Design
### core idea
People often blame themselves for mistakes, but Norman argues that errors are usually the result of bad design, not human incompetence. Good design anticipates errors, prevents them when possible, and helps users recover gracefully.

### Why Errors Happen
 - Human limitations (memory lapses, distraction, stress).
 - Poor interfaces that confuse or mislead users.
 - Social and institutional pressures that force people into error-prone actions (e.g., rushing, multitasking).
