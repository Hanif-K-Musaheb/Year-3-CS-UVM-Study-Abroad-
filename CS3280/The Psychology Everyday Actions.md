## The gulfs of execution and evaluation
###### Definition:
 - The gap between what a user wants to do and what actions the system allows or makes possible.
#### Design issues that <ins>widen</ins> the Gulf of Execution:
 - Hidden controls
 - Poor signifiers
 - Confusing mappings
 - Too many steps or choices

#### Design techniques that <ins>reduce</ins> it:

 - Clear signifiers
 - Logical mapping
 - Discoverable actions
 - Constraints that guide correct action

## The seven stages of actions
> Norman describes user action as a cycle with seven cognitive steps, divided into Execution and Evaluation.
###### Definition:
 - The gap between what the system shows and how well the user can understand what happened.
#### EXECUTION
1. Goal (Forming the Goal)
    - What do I want to accomplish?
    - Example: “I want to print this document.”
2. Plan (Forming the Intention)
    - How will I accomplish it?
    - Example: “I will open the print menu.”
3. Specify (Specifying an Action)
    - What specific actions do I take?
    - Example: “I will click the ‘Print’ button.”
4. Perform (Performing the Action)
    - The actual execution of the action.
    - Example: Clicking the button.
#### EVALUATION
5. Perceive (Perceiving the State of the System)
   - What do I see/hear/feel after performing the action?
   - Example: A print confirmation appears.
6. Interpret (Interpreting the System State)
   - What does this feedback mean?
   - Example: “The document is being sent to the printer.”
7. Compare (Evaluating Against the Goal)
   - Did the result match my original goal?
   - Example: “Yes, the printer started printing.”
