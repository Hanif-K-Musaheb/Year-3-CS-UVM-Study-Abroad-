### How to define and measure usability
###### What is usability?
>The extent to which a system can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals, with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.

#### 3 components of usability
|component|Decript|
|---|---|
|**Effectiveness**|Task success rate, Number of errors, Quality of output, Completion of required steps|
|**Efficiency**|Time on task, Number of clicks or steps, Mental/physical effort, Learning time|
|**Satisfaction**|User satisfaction questionnaires (SUS, UMUX), User ratings (Likert scales), Interviews & subjective feedback

#### How to measure usability

1. Usability Testing (most common)
    - Observe users performing tasks
    - Collect effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction data
2. Surveys & Questionnaires
    - SUS (System Usability Scale)
    - Single Ease Question (SEQ)
3. Analytics & Logs
    - Clicks, scroll depth, drop-off rates
4. Heuristic Evaluation
    - Experts evaluate based on Nielsen/Norman heuristics
5. A/B Testing
    - Compare two versions to measure performance differences
### What Fitts’ Law is about
##### Definition:
> Fitts’ Law predicts the time it takes to move to a target (like a button) based on:

> Distance to the target

> Size of the target

##### The formula:
- The **closer** and **larger** a target is, the **faster** it is to **hit**.
  
### Accessibility 
|Impairment|Descript|
|---|---|
|Visual impairments| Color blindness, Low vision or blindness|
|Auditory impairments|Hard of hearing or deafness|
|Motor impairments| Limited mobility, Tremors, Difficulty with precise movements|
|Cognitive impairments | Dyslexia, Memory limitations, ADHD, Learning difficulties|

### Universal design
**Definition**: Universal design aims to create products usable by all people, not just those with disabilities, without the need for adaptation.

##### 7 Principles of Universal Design:

- **Equitable Use** --> The design is useful to people with diverse abilities
- **Flexibility in Use** --> Supports a wide range of preferences
- **Simple & Intuitive** --> Easy to understand regardless of experience
- **Perceptible Information** --> Communicates information effectively
- **Tolerance for Error** --> Minimizes negative consequences
- **Low Physical Effort** --> Requires minimal fatigue
- **Size & Space for Use** --> Appropriate size and spacing
