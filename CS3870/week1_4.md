# Week 2
**Data scope**: the relationship between the research question and the data collection process
>Data are often restricted in scope (incomplete coverage of the target phenomenon)

**Representativeness**: Degree to which data **reflect** the population / system / behavior of interest
> Lack of representativeness → limited, misleading, or incorrect inference

##### Accuracy concerns:
- **Bias**: systematic error introduced by data collection or measurement
- **Variation**: random noise in observations
>Big data ≠ good data --> Large datasets can still fail due to poor data scope or bias


 - **Causality**: when a treatment directly produces a change in an outcome
 - **Association**: any observed relationship between treatment and outcome
> Association ≠ causation
- **Observational study**:
    - Researchers do not assign treatments
    - Data are observed as they naturally occur
    - **Components of an observational study**:
      - **Individuals**: units being studied (people, states, etc.)
      - **Treatment**: factor of interest (e.g., chocolate consumption, death penalty law)
      - **Outcome**: measured response (e.g., heart disease rate, murder rate)
