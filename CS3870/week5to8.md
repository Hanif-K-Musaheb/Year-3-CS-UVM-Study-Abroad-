## feb 10
- **n** - sample size
- **y i** - the particular observations
- **y hat** - predicted observations given by our model
- **greek letters** parameters in the model
- **lamda** - rate of
- **theta hat** -  represents optimal parameters
- parameters tell us the relationships between our input and output variables are
- **constant model** predict the same number for everyone
- linear regression
- logistic regression
- prediction vs estimation
- loss function- how wrong you are (actual -  predicted)
- L1 loss
- L2 loss
- MSE
- MAE
## feb 12
### Cross- validation
### modelling process
- choose model
- choose loss function (L1,L1)
- fit the model minimizing average loss (MSE MAE)
- validation of model
### Training and Testing
 - Training and testing set

### k-fold cross validation
