### Additive Inverse
In simple terms:
 - Additive inverse of a number = the negative of that number
 - The additive inverse of 5 is −5, because
   - `5+(−5)=0`
  
#### How it works
Start with the binary number.
##### Example: 
 - `0101` (which is 5 in decimal).
 - Invert all the bits (flip 0→1, 1→0).
   - `0101→1010`
 - Add 1 to the result. `1010+1=1011`
 - So, `1011₂` is the additive inverse of `0101₂` in 4-bit two’s complement — it represents −5.
