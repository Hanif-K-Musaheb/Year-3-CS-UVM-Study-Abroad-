## Algorithm analysis
Lecture 2 basics of algorithm complexity
#### preliminaries
All stuff covered throughly in previous years
#### Details
 - we'll divide the world into problems for which there is a polynomial-time algorithm
 - and problems for which there is NO polynomial-time algorithm
 - and we'll call these efficient vs. non-efficient algorithms
 - and tractable vs. intractable problems
### Asymptotic Upper Bounds
#### Basic idea
 - we want to bound the runtime of an algorithm by some simple function of 𝑛 (the problem size)
#### Definition:
 - let 𝑇 𝑛 be a function—say the worst-case runtime of a certain algorithm on an input of size 𝑛
 - in these discussions, we'll assume that all of these functions have nonnegative values
 - then, given another function 𝑓(𝑛), we say that 𝑇(𝑛) is 𝒪(𝑓 𝑛 ) if, for sufficiently large 𝑛, 𝑇 𝑛 is bounded above by a constant multiple of 𝑓(𝑛)
 - read this as “𝑇(𝑛) is order 𝑓(𝑛)
