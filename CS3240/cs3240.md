### Proof by Induction
same stuff covered by 1st year uofg maths

##### Base Case
Show the statement is true for the first value (e.g., 𝑛=1).
✅ This starts the chain.

##### Inductive Hypothesis
Assume the statement 𝑃(𝑘)
P(k) is true for some arbitrary 𝑘
(We don’t prove it here—we just assume it.)

##### Inductive Step
Using the assumption, prove that 
P(k+1) is also true.
✅ This shows that if the statement holds for one number, it holds for the next.
