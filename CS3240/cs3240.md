### (1) [Network flow](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-3-CS-UVM-Study-Abroad-/blob/main/CS3240/network-flow.md)
  - know the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm: be able to find a max flow on a network using FF
  - understand what constitutes a valid flow: be able to check whether a flow is valid
  (capacity, conservation conditions)
  - understand cuts in a network, and the capacity of a cut
  - know the relationship between a max flow and a min cut
  - grad students: understand why FF will terminate and why it will produce a max flow
### (2) Knapsack problem
  - be able to solve a Knapsack problem (with weights and values), as in the written
  assignment
  - be able to write each OPT value in terms of other OPT values
  - understand what the base cases are for the OPT function
  - be able fill out the memoization array, showing which OPT values you used
  - be able to fill in all the values in the memoization array
### (3) Independent sets and vertex covers
  - understand the definition of an independent set and of a vertex cover
  - be able to construct an independent set or a vertex cover on a given graph
### [(4) Other terms and definitions—know each of these:](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-3-CS-UVM-Study-Abroad-/blob/main/CS3240/other_terms.md)
  - bipartiteness (as in a bipartite graph)
  - a matching on a bipartite graph
  - completeness (as in a complete graph)
  - the degree of a node in a graph
