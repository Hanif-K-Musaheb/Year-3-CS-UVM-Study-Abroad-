-  [x] Dijkstra’s Algorithm: be able to trace the algorithm
-  [x] minimum spanning trees: characteristics; tracing Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms
-  [x] be able to describe and apply (but not prove) the cycle property and the cut property
-  [x] ~~graduate students: be able to understand why Dijkstra’s algorithm produces correct
results~~
- [x] ~~graduate students: be able to explain why the cycle property and the cut property~~
hold

##### Divide and tackle
- [ ] recurrence relations: understanding a recurrence relation; being able to write a
recurrence relation given the description of a divide-and-tackle algorithm
- [ ] unrolling trees: drawing an unrolling tree; showing the total work at each level
- [ ] steps involved in showing a bound for T(n) using an unrolling tree
- [ ] ~~graduate students: be able to set up and complete a proof by induction for a simple
recurrence relation~~

Graphs: definitions, characteristics
- [ ] paths and cycles
- [ ] directed vs. undirected
- [ ] connectedness; connected components (of an undirected graph)
- [ ] strongly connected components (of a directed graph)
- [ ] BFS and DFS traversal; tracing the algorithms
- [ ] bipartite graphs: definition; determining bipartiteness
- [ ] topological ordering of directed graphs: definition, implications, algorithm
