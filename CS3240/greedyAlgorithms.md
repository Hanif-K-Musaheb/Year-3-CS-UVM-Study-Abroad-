 Interval scheduling: be able to trace the algorithm
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm: be able to trace the algorithm
- minimum spanning trees: characteristics; tracing Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms
- be able to describe and apply (but not prove) the cycle property and the cut property
- graduate students: be able to understand why Dijkstra’s algorithm produces correct
results
- graduate students: be able to explain why the cycle property and the cut property
hold
