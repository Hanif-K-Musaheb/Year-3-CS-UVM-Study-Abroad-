# Lecture 1: Creating a program
#### Requirement Gathering
 - **Functional requirements** – what the program does (e.g., search for a recipe).
 - **Nonfunctional requirements** – how it works (usability, speed, security, readability).

#### Design

 - Plan structure before coding:
   - Define **class design** (e.g., Recipe, Ingredient).
   - Define **database schema** if applicable.
   - Focus on **architecture**, **not** syntax.

#### Testing

Not just after coding — test during development.
 - **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
     - Write tests before writing code.
     - Enables independent code and test creation.
 - **Types of Testing**:
     - **Black-box** (tester doesn’t know internal design).
     - **White-box** (tester knows internal structure).
     - **alpha/Beta** testing by real users.
