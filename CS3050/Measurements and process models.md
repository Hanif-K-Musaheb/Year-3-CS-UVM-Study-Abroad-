## Measurements of Code (Product Metrics)
>These measure characteristics of the software itself—the code, structure, and design.

### Lines of Code (LOC)
>obvious
### Cyclomatic Complexity (McCabe Complexity)
 - **What it measures:**
   - The number of independent paths through the code
   - Essentially: how complicated the logic is
 - **Why it’s useful:**
   - Helps identify code that is difficult to test
   - High complexity ⇒ more bugs likely
   - Highlights functions that should be refactored
### Cohesion
> said in previous topic
### Coupling
### Fan-in / Fan-out
### Code Coverage (from testing)
> **What it measures**: % of code executed by tests

### Defect Density
> **What it measures**: Number of bugs per LOC or per module
