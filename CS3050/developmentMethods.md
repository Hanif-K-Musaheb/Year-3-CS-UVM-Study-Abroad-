# [Development Methods](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-3-CS-UVM-Study-Abroad-/blob/main/CS3050/CS3050home.md)
## Waterfall Method
- This model follow a set of procedures done sequentially and only once
- better for porjects that can be iterative, that must be right on the first try. Like a spaceship software or X ray machine

Advantage | Explanation
|-----|-----|
time to release | the customer does not have to wait for the entire system to be complete before use
feedback | user's feedback from use of early increments helps guide subsequent releases
risk | there is a lower risk of overall project failure (the user will at least get something)
testing | the most important features get the most testing, since they are the first ones that we develop and deploy

Disadvantage 
|-----------|
it can be difficult to map requirements on to separate, staged deliveries
it can be difficult to account for fundamental system components that are needed in all increments
the process is not visible; it can be difficult for project managers to track progress, since the only products of the development are successive versions of the software
system structure tends to degrade as new increments are added


## Component-Based Software Engineering
Basic description: the development team glues together things they already have to produce a system that meets the client's needs

### Advantages and disadvantages:
 - main **advantage** is encapsulation: the team does not have to worry about developing and testing the components that are already available
 - main **disadvantage**: lack of flexibility—the team is constrained by the components they have, and so they have to try to satisfy the requirements within this constraint
### Use Case
It's great for development teams that need to quickly and repeatedly build similar systems
 - **example**: custom scheduling systems for auto-repair businesses or for medical practices
