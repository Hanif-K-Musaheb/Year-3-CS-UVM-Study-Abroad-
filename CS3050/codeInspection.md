# [Code inspection — given a block of Python code](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-3-CS-UVM-Study-Abroad-/blob/main/CS3050/CS3050home.md)
## Exam Strategy for Code Inspection Questions
#### What Code Inspection Means
1. What the code does (its functionality).
1. How well it is written (quality).
1. How it could be improved (clarity, performance, style, maintainability).
#### When you get a block of code:
 - Step 1: State its overall purpose
    - One clear sentence summarizing what the code accomplishes.
 - Step 2: Describe how it works
    - Mention loops, conditionals, data structures, and modifications made.
 - Step 3: Identify issues or inefficiencies
     - Naming?
     - Repetition?
     - Unclear logic?
     - Unnecessary steps?
 - Step 4: Suggest improvements with justification
   - “This improves readability…”  (Readability Improvements)
   - “This prevents errors…” (error handling) 
   - “This improves performance…”(Avoiding Repetition or Unnecessary Code) 
   - “This uses built-in Python features…” (Using Built-in Python Features)

#### How to Examine a Block of Python Code
|Examination|decript|
|------|-----|
|Inputs and Outputs|What values does it take in?,  What does it return or print?|
Control Flow|Loops (for/while), Conditionals (if/elif/else), Function calls
Variables and Data Structures|Lists, dictionaries, sets, etc. ,  How they are accessed or modified.
Algorithmic Behavior| What problem does it solve?, What steps does it follow?
Code Style & Readability| Meaningful names?, Clear structure?, Comments where needed?
Efficiency| Unnecessary loops?, Repeated calculations?, Could built-in functions be used?
