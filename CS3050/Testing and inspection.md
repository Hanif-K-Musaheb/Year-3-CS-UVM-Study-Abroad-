# [Testing and inspection](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-3-CS-UVM-Study-Abroad-/blob/main/CS3050/CS3050home.md)
## Kinds of Testing and Their Value
>Software testing aims to **find defects** and **verify** that the **system meets requirements**.

### Unit Testing
>**What it is:** Testing individual functions or modules in isolation.

### Integration Testing
> **What it is:** Testing how modules work together (interfaces between units).

### System Testing
>**What it is:** Testing the complete system as a whole.

### Acceptance Testing
>**What it is:** Testing by the customer or end user (e.g., UAT).

### Regression Testing
>**What it is:** Re-running tests after changes to confirm nothing broke.

### Performance Testing
>**Examples:** Load testing, stress testing, scalability testing.

### Black-box Testing 
>Tester does not look at internal code.
>Tests inputs and outputs only.

### White-box Testing
>Tester examines the code.
>Tests internal logic and paths.

## What Inspection Does
>Examines code, design, or documentation line by line.


|Kind of test|Value|Value|Value|Value|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|**Unit Testing**|Catches bugs early|Ensures each part works correctly before integration|Makes refactoring safer|Supports maintainability|
|**Integration Testing**|Finds problems caused by module interactions| Detects mismatched interfaces or data formats|||
|**System Testing**|Ensures the system meets requirements| Looks at performance, functionality, reliability overall|||
|**Acceptance Testing**|Confirms the system meets user expectations|Final check before release|Helps ensure usability||
|**Regression Testing**|Prevents new bugs from appearing due to updates|Essential for stable releases|||
|**Performance Testing**| Ensures system meets speed, stability, and resource usage requirements|Detects bottlenecks|||
|**Black Box Testing**|Tests from a user perspective|Good for validating requirements|||
|**White Box Testing**|Tester examines the code.|Tests internal logic and paths.|||


#### Finds mistakes such as:
 - logic errors
 - violations of style guidelines
 - missing cases
 - poor naming
 - security issues
 - maintainability problems
