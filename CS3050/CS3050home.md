### Topics in review for midterm
* general characteristics of software
    - [x] characteristics of users
    - [x] how users use a particular software application—what they hope to accomplish
    - [x] implications of failure
    - [x] risk of failure, and how to reduce the risk of failure
* software development processes
    - [x] characteristics of a process
    - [x] the need for a process (why?)
* user scenarios
    - [ ] what they are
    - [ ] how and when they can be used
* the two main development processes: waterfall, iterative
    - [ ] characteristics of each
    - [ ] advantages and disadvantages of each
    - [ ] how the different aspects of each process are manifested in the software created by
    that process
    - [ ] the different kinds of systems each is suited for
* the four main phases of software engineering: specification, design/development,
validation, evolution
    - [ ] the activities that each phase consists of
    - [ ] the goals of each phase
    - [ ] how each phase is mapped to specific actions in waterfall or iterative processes
* requirements
    - [ ] what they are
    - [ ] the two broad classes: functional vs. nonfunctional
    - [ ] processes for gathering requirements, and the advantages/disadvantages of these
processes
