- know characteristics of each model
- know advantages and disadvantages of each model
- be able to describe for which kinds of applications each model is suitable

- goals of detailed design
- cohesion and coupling in a design or in an implementation
- implications of coupling/cohesion and high/low fan-in/fan-out
#### (3) [Code inspection — given a block of Python code:](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-3-CS-UVM-Study-Abroad-/blob/main/CS3050/codeInspection.md)
- be able to examine the code and describe what it’s doing
- be able to suggest changes to the code and how each change improves the code
#### (4) [Measurements and process models](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-3-CS-UVM-Study-Abroad-/blob/main/CS3050/Measurements%20and%20process%20models.md)
- aspects of code that we can measure, and how the measurements can be useful
- aspects of processes we can measure, and how the measurements can be useful
#### (5) [Testing and inspection](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-3-CS-UVM-Study-Abroad-/blob/main/CS3050/Testing%20and%20inspection.md)
