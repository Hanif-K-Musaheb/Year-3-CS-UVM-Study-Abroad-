### Charactaristics of users
|**Charactaristic**|Descript|
|-------|--------|
|**Diverse skill levels**| Users can range from novice to expert.|
|**Different goals**|Each user might use the same software to accomplish different objectives.|
|**Expectations for usability**|Users want software that is intuitive, responsive, and reliable.|
|**Reliance on feedback**| Users expect clear feedback (messages, prompts, error alerts.|
|**Tolerance for error**| Some users are patient and forgiving; others expect flawless operation.|

### How users use a particular software application
