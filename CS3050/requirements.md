**Software requirements** describe what a system should do and the conditions it must meet to satisfy user and business needs.
##### In short
 - **A requirement is a statement of what the software must accomplish or how it must behave.**
### Functional Requirments
 - These define what the system should do — the specific functions, features, and behaviors it must perform.
 - **Examples:**
   - The system shall allow users to log in using an email and password.
   - The software shall generate monthly financial reports.
   - The app shall send an email notification when a file is uploaded.
 - **Focus**: Behavior, actions, inputs, and outputs of the system.

### Nonfunction Requirements (Quality Attributes)
These describe how the system performs its functions — focusing on **performance**, **usability**, **reliability**, and **constraints**.
##### Examples:
 - The system shall respond to user actions within 2 seconds.
 - The system shall be available 99.9% of the time.
 - The user interface shall be intuitive and accessible.

#### Categories of nonfunctional requirements:
- **Performance** (speed, efficiency)
- **Reliability** (uptime, fault tolerance)
- **Usability** (ease of use)
- **Security** (data protection)
- **Maintainability** (ease of modification)
- **Portability** (works on multiple platforms)
