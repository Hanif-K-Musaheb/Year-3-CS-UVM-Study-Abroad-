# [Requirements](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-3-CS-UVM-Study-Abroad-/blob/main/CS3050/CS3050home.md)
**Software requirements** describe what a system should do and the conditions it must meet to satisfy user and business needs.
##### In short
 - **A requirement is a statement of what the software must accomplish or how it must behave.**
### Functional Requirments
 - These define what the system should do — the specific functions, features, and behaviors it must perform.
 - **Examples:**
   - The system shall allow users to log in using an email and password.
   - The software shall generate monthly financial reports.
   - The app shall send an email notification when a file is uploaded.
 - **Focus**: Behavior, actions, inputs, and outputs of the system.

### Nonfunction Requirements (Quality Attributes)
These describe how the system performs its functions — focusing on **performance**, **usability**, **reliability**, and **constraints**.
##### Examples:
 - The system shall respond to user actions within 2 seconds.
 - The system shall be available 99.9% of the time.
 - The user interface shall be intuitive and accessible.

#### Categories of nonfunctional requirements:
- **Performance** (speed, efficiency)
- **Reliability** (uptime, fault tolerance)
- **Usability** (ease of use)
- **Security** (data protection)
- **Maintainability** (ease of modification)
- **Portability** (works on multiple platforms)


### Processes for Gathering Requirements
The process of collecting, understanding, and documenting requirements is called Requirements Elicitation (or Requirements Gathering).
It involves interacting with stakeholders to discover what they need.

##### Requirement Gathering Methods
| **Method**                        | **Description**                                                           | **Advantages**                                                    | **Disadvantages**                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interviews**                    | One-on-one or small-group discussions with stakeholders to uncover needs. | Deep insight; personal interaction; clarifies misunderstandings.  | Time-consuming; depends on communication skills; may miss conflicting views. |
| **Questionnaires / Surveys**      | Written questions distributed to a large number of users.                 | Efficient for large audiences; easy to analyze quantitatively.    | Limited depth; responses may lack context or detail.                         |
| **Workshops / Focus Groups**      | Structured group meetings to brainstorm and discuss requirements.         | Encourages collaboration; identifies conflicts early.             | Can be hard to manage; dominant personalities may skew results.              |
| **Observation (Job Shadowing)**   | Watching users perform their tasks in real environments.                  | Reveals real workflows and hidden needs; captures context.        | Time-consuming; may make users self-conscious or alter behavior.             |
| **Document Analysis**             | Reviewing existing system documents, policies, or reports.                | Good for background information; helps understand legacy systems. | Might be outdated or incomplete; lacks direct user input.                    |
| **Prototyping**                   | Building a sample or mock-up of the system to gather feedback.            | Users visualize system early; clarifies vague requirements.       | Can create unrealistic expectations if treated as a finished product.        |
| **Brainstorming / Storyboarding** | Generating ideas quickly through group creativity sessions.               | Stimulates innovation; identifies diverse needs.                  | Requires skilled facilitation; can lack focus if unstructured.               |



### Best Practices for Gathering Requirements

 - Involve all key stakeholders early and often.
 - Use multiple methods — no single technique captures everything.
 - Maintain clear, testable, and prioritized requirements.
 - Review and validate requirements with users regularly.
 - Document requirements in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
