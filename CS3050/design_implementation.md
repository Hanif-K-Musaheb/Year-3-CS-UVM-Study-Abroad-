# [Characteristics of a design and of the implementation](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-3-CS-UVM-Study-Abroad-/blob/main/CS3050/CS3050home.md)

(2) Characteristics of a design and of the implementation
- goals of detailed design
- cohesion and coupling in a design or in an implementation
- implications of coupling/cohesion and high/low fan-in/fan-out

### Characteristics of a Design

|Charactaristic|Descript|
|---------------|-------|
|Correctness|(obvious)The design must meet all stated requirements, It should fully and accurately represent the system's intended behavior.|
|Completeness|(obvious)All required components, interfaces, and data structures are specified, No missing functionality.|
|Consistency|(obvious)No conflicting definitions, naming conventions, or interfaces, Interfaces must match across modules.|
|Efficiency|(obvious)Design should allow efficient implementation (performance, memory, etc.).|
|Modularity|(obvious)System divided into clear, independent modules.|
|Maintainability|(obvious)Easy to update, fix, or extend later.|
|Reusability|(obvious)Components can be reused in other systems or contexts.|

### Characteristics of an Implementation
|Charactaristic|Descript|
|--------------|--------|
|Correctness|-|
|Readability|Code should be easy to understand (clear names, consistent formatting).|
|Reliability|Code should run without frequent failures.|
|Efficiency|-|
|Testability|Code must be structured so tests can be created and executed easily.|
|Maintainability|-|
|Robustness|Handles errors and unexpected input safely.|
