|`halt.`|	Exits the Prolog terminal and goes back to your regular bash/zsh shell.|
|`make.`	|  Super useful: If you change your .pl file and save it, type make. in the terminal to "refresh" the code without restarting.|
|`[filename].`	|  An alternative way to load a file (e.g., `[autism].`).|
|`;`	|  If Prolog finds one answer and waits, type `;` to ask "Are there any more?"|
